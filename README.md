# Astro260Homework3

When you run Homework3.py, it will generate two text files with data (problem_1_1_data.txt and problem_1_2_data.txt). 
Then run Homework3Plot1.py. This will show the graph for part 1 of problem 1.
Homework3Part2.py is the code for problem 2. Running this will run all the calculations and show the graph
for problem 2. It does the graphing in this file, so no text file is written for this part. 
Homework3.txt is a text file answering the question 3 from problem 2, as well as mentioning
the issues I had with part 2 of problem 1.
